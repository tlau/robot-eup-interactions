I never thought I would be a roboticist. In grad school, our robotics team spent months teaching little robot dogs to play soccer and solving other seemingly simple problems. I was better off in the world of software, I thought, where the systems I built could make a real difference in people's lives. Software robots would automate repetitive tasks in computer use and free people from mundane work. End user programming would enable millions of ordinary computer users to customize and adapt systems to their own needs.

But that world is changing. People aren't primarily sitting in front of their computers, pushing bits around. Nowadays, innovation is happening in the real world, where computing is being used to effect physical change in the world around us. The past decades have seen industrial robots increase manufacturing efficiency on the factory floor. Even more, we are now seeing robots popping up in the consumer space. Robotic vacuum cleaners are changing the way we clean our homes. Robotic lawnmowers keep the yard tidy without having to lift a finger. Nest's robotic thermostat learns your habits and keeps your home at the optimal temperature.

All these innovations have become possible through multiple advances: in sensor technology, which robots use to perceive the world around them; in planning and navigation, which enable robots to move around in the world unaided; in human-safe motion controllers, which let robots move their limbs without endangering humans around them; in the ROS open source robot operating system, which enables roboticists to build on each others' work without starting from scratch; and many more advances in the broader field of robotics.

Yet despite all of these advances, the holy grail of personal robotics remains elusive. When will we have our own Rosie the Robot (from the Jetsons cartoon) to take over housekeeping chores? Since starting work at Willow Garage and becoming immersed in the challenges of the robotics industry, I now believe that the limiting factor is end user programming.



















Why robotics is becoming important
Statistics on size of market
Number of research investments?

Main points:
	EUP is what will enable robotics to spawn new industries
	by enabling businesses to customize robot behavior for their own needs

	Yet programming robots is difficult
	State of the art today is demonstrational, which works well for limited, repetitive tasks
	Or using highly technical tools to specify fine-grained robot behavior
	Behavior specification requires much deep technical knowledge
	Not only the traditionally hard topics in EUP such as conditionals, loops, variables
	But also advanced topics like concurrency, uncertainty, high-dimensionality

The challenge for robotics is to bring robots to market that are consumer-friendly and can operate in human environments. For limited tasks, we are seeing robots that can perform one single task very well without getting in the way of the humans in the household. Vacuum cleaner robots like the iRobot's Roomba and the Neato XV are flooding the market. The Robomow robotic lawn mower performs a similar task for your lawn. Undoubtedly their success is due to their extremely simple interface: the Roomba has a single large button labeled ``Clean''.

\section{ROS}

History of ROS
Invented by Willow Garage, new operating system for diverse robots
Current reach
running on robots from PR2 to android-powered XXX
Provides very rich control substrate for programming the behavior of complex robots

\section{Concurrency}

ROS nodes
multiple parts of robots (head, arms, base)
callbacks, coroutines, threads

\section{Uncertainty}

World changes out from under you
Hardware fails
Incomplete world models
Bayesian methods, probabilities

\section{High-dimensionality}

Robot arms have 7DOF
grasps require 6D
world is 3D
quaternions, matrix manipulation
specialized I/O devices
