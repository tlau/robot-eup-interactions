Despite many advances in robotics, we are still a long way from enjoying robot butlers in our homes. A large part of the problem is that defining robot behavior boils down to robot programming, which is still very difficult for ordinary consumers. In this article, I examine some of the fundamental challenges for robot programming and outline possible solutions based on end user programming that could make personal robotics more widespread.
